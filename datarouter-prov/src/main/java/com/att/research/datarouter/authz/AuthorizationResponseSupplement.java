 * obligation elements.  The structure of a XACML advice element and a XACML obligation element are similar: each has an identifier and
 * a set of attributes (name-value) pairs.  (The difference between a XACML advice element and a XACML obligation element is in
 * how the recipient of the response--the Policy Enforcement Point, in XACML terminology--handles the element.)
