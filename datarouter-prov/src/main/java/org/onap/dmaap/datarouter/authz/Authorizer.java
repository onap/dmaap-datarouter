 * A Data Router API that requires authorization of incoming requests creates an instance of a class that implements

 * local logic that makes the authorization decision.  After R1, these classes will instead have logic that creates XACML
 * authorization requests, sends these requests to a Policy Decision Point (PDP), and parses the XACML responses.
